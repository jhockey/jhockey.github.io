                    <p>This project, initiated on February 29, 2023, and responds to a prompt focusing on creating transformative design innovations that can potentially change the world. Reflecting on my own experiences with a life-altering impairment, I chose to work on a project that helped individuals with disabilities. <br><br>

                        The primary objective was to instigate change in how people affected by disabilities could interact with the world, with the goal of garnering government involvement and funding. The project remains an ongoing endeavour.<br><br>
                        
                        The broader project objectives or the ‘What’ of this project were to help individuals with disabilities interact in a world not inherently designed for them, improve the overall quality of life for people with disabilities and advocate for accessibility for the people affected by them. The motivation for this project stemmed from my own experience as someone with a disability and the prevalent lack of accessibility to basic human needs and desires that people affected by disabilities face in their day-to-day lives. With the limited awareness of the struggles people with disabilities face, many needs are overlooked, and even when an attempt to help is made, many ‘solutions’  end up being inadequate or stigmatising. If the world were more accessible to these people, they might be able to perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the world in ways they could not before. Interacting with the world seems like a fundamental human experience, but it is a luxury to those less fortunate.<br><br>

                        To tackle this project, I employed the design thinking framework I talk about in the about me and my work page<> to identify and attempt to help ‘solve’ a challenge faced by people with disabilities. The potential outcomes of undergoing a project like this are increased accessibility for people with disabilities, contributing to their active participation in society, enriching the overall experience for everyone through inclusive design, and the addition of new points of view, outlooks and opinions being shared in communities, resulting in a continuous feedback loop of potential improvements, solutions and inventions to further help the disabled community live easier lives.<br><br>

                        The initial timeline for this project was fifteen weeks. However, after the initial project presentation, the project has been worked on further, is still ongoing and will likely continue to be worked on in the future as it has become a part of a multifaceted service/design system with the potential to grow even further than it already has in scale.<br><br>

                        <p class="aboagreen">A service system is like a network of interconnected cogs, coordinating diverse elements such as processes, people, and technology. Together, they efficiently deliver a range of services, ensuring a well-orchestrated and effective operation. In this case the ABOA platform is one of the ‘cogs’ in the overall system of this project.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 order-md-2">
                    <p>The first step of the ABOA project was to pinpoint a problem within the disabled community that required attention. To do this, direct communication with those who may be affected by the project was essential.<br><br>

                        Starting with identifying stakeholders, the project considered people with disabilities (PWD), families and caregivers, disability organisations and their staff, businesses and venues, government regulators and policymakers, and the general public. Over the initial 15 weeks, I interviewed twenty-three individuals and surveyed thirty-six. The early stages of the ABOA project focused on people directly impacted by disabilities, including PWD, families of PWD, friends of PWD, and disability organisation workers. The goal was to delve into the challenges faced by those with disabilities, understand existing solutions, and assess their effectiveness. Consequently, the central theme of discussions revolved around the barriers and struggles experienced by PWDs, highlighting their own experiences with living with a disability.<br><br>
                        
                        Considering the diverse nature of disabilities, even conditions appearing identical on paper can present differences in the flesh. Despite this, the results of the interviews unveiled various common challenges among PWDs. These encompassed difficulties in socialising and interacting, feelings of loneliness and isolation, struggles in navigating outside the home, finding accessible and enjoyable venues, accidental encounters with dangerous situations in public, mistreatment by others, lack of information on coping with disabilities, challenges in accepting and supporting loved ones with disabilities, and understanding and accessing support systems, resources, and services.<br><br>

                        It is important to note that the initial 15-week timeline and limited access to a small dataset of stakeholders could cause future problems for the ABOA project. Recognising potential biases in the insights gathered from such a small pool is crucial. In human-centred design, effective solutions hinge on insights obtained from user-centred ethnographic research. In an ideal world, a project like this would have a data set of tens of thousands to confidently confirm the insights are accurate across a large population. While the small dataset poses limitations, to attempt to combat the assumption of needs of PWDs, regular workshops with disabled volunteers, personas, empathy maps, journey maps, previous studies and data from desktop research were used to inform the design process moving forward.<br><br>
                        
                        Another consideration to minimise the assumption of needs of the ABOA project’s target audience was to narrow its initial scope to only focus on Australia, a decision rooted in several key considerations. Firstly, focusing on a specific cultural context allows for a nuanced understanding of Australian perspectives on disability, ensuring solutions are culturally sensitive and aligned with local values. Secondly, narrowing the scope acknowledges the global variations in disability regulations, prompting a phased approach tailored to Australian regulations. This focused strategy optimises resource allocation, engages with stakeholders more effectively, and provides an opportunity for pilot testing and refinement within the confines of the Australian landscape. The insights specific to Australia facilitated the creation of solutions precisely tailored to the local population’s needs, establishing a solid foundation for future global scalability.<br><br>

                    <p>After ten weeks of desktop research, group discussion and co-creation, ideation, and reflecting on insights and data, I felt I understood enough about the problems, current solutions, and people involved (as much as I could with a fifteen-week time limit) to finalise an answer that would attempt to meet the project’s goals. I moved forward and centred the project on fostering mutual support among individuals with disabilities. The core idea was to empower disabled individuals and people affected by them to support each other. The envisioned online platform was intended to emphasise creating a space for disability-centric discussions, providing community-tested knowledge and experiences relevant to various locations and businesses across Australia. It would be a place to alleviate feelings of isolation, promote community engagement, and offer a haven for advice, enabling individuals to understand the opportunities and services available to them better and navigate the challenges associated with living with a disability.<br><br>

                        This vision led to naming the project ‘Abled by One Another’ or ‘ABOA’ for short, to remind people that they aren’t alone and that others in the world can relate to the pains that often go unrecognised by those around us. By coming together, we can support each other through the hard times, coach each other through the scary uncertainties, and help able each other to live better lives.<br><br>
                        
                        As a part of the project, I created a brand identity and guidelines for the ABOA platform, designed to be inherently accessible, following standard accessibility guidelines. When crafting a brand identity tailored for individuals with disabilities, it’s crucial to prioritise accessibility on various fronts. The primary focus is to create a visually, cognitively, and audibly inclusive experience. To do this, I opted for a simple and clean design to help minimise cognitive load while ensuring high colour contrast and readable fonts enhance visual accessibility. Incorporating audible cues or equivalents for graphical elements like a logo or text caters to users with visual impairments. Clear visual hierarchies and straightforward language contribute to visually and cognitively impaired accessibility.<br><br>
                        
                        To amplify inclusivity, marketing materials feature diverse representations of people with disabilities. Compliance with international accessibility standards, such as WCAG, is paramount when developing an app or website, with the main concern being alt text for audio and subtitles for visual (anything audio needs subtitles, anything visual needs alt text for audio readers). The best way for the brand to stay accessible is by collaborating with accessibility experts and staying up-to-date on evolving guidelines to ensure ongoing improvement in accessibility features. This holistic approach aims to create a brand identity and service that is visually appealing and, more importantly, accessible to diverse users.<br><br>
                        
                        The platform’s functionalities were crafted to address the target audience’s specific needs. I evaluated their effectiveness through a Kano model feature satisfaction survey to understand what the platform should do to help its users achieve the app’s goals. Using BDD - Ghirkin Statements, I wrote out the platform’s must-have features and how users would traverse them. Subsequently, I transformed these written representations into visual task flow diagrams, leading to the development of wireframes encapsulating the primary components of the app using user experience and user interface (UX/UI) principles as a framework for how the app would look. I then crafted working compositions as a proof of concept to establish the groundwork for building and testing a prototype and garnering attention for the project from the public.<br><br>

                            <p>The Community feature serves as a central hub for PWDs and those affected by PWDs to engage in discussions covering a spectrum of disability-related topics. Users can filter posts based on relevance, opting for the most popular community discussions, forums they follow, or those explicitly suggested based on their onboarding and activity on the app. As mentioned, the filtering system of the community feature includes three main categories: ‘Following,’ displaying posts from joined communities; ‘Popular,’ offering real-time insights into the most trending discussions across all forums; and ‘For You,’ curating posts from communities related to the user’s following and activity that they may not have interacted with. <br><br>
                                
                                Community forums are systematically categorized on a national, state, metro area, and local government area (LGA) basis. Each page incorporates filters for various disabilities/impairments, eliminating the need for redundant communities for the same locations. For instance, rather than creating separate communities like ‘Metro Area: Perth Sight’ and ‘Metro Area: Perth Hearing,’ a more inclusive approach with sub-pages such as ‘Metro Area / Perth / Sight’ and ‘Metro Area / Perth / Hearing’ is adopted. All forums are structured this way (hierarchy identifier tag/name of location/category of disability or impairment. This strategy facilitates broader connections among individuals experiencing similar challenges related to disabilities. It helps people find the correct forums to post on. <br><br>
                                
                                The categorized community pages encompass a range of disability types, including Physical, Sight, Hearing, Cognitive, Neurological, Speech, and Psychological impairments. These categories serve as inclusive spaces for individuals with similar disabilities to share experiences, coping mechanisms, and valuable information.<br><br> Furthermore, there are specific disability/impairment communities tailored to unique conditions, providing a platform for individuals facing similar circumstances to discuss experimental treatments, dietary insights, and other condition-specific details. In terms of user engagement, someone’s ‘Following’ may involve a hierarchy from specific conditions to broader communities like ‘Australia / Sight,’ ‘State/ Western Australia / Sight,’ ‘Metro Area / Perth / Sight,’ and ‘LGA / City of Melville / Sight.’ This layered approach ensures users receive not only disability-specific but also location-centric information, fostering a comprehensive and tailored user experience. The Community feature was meticulously iterated to empower users to achieve their primary goals within the platform.

                            <p>In the final week of the project, the app underwent crucial testing to enhance accessibility, focusing on the community and location features and engaging members of the disabled community, particularly those with vision impairments. While the insights collected aren't definitive, they provided invaluable individual-level feedback, steering improvements in the app's design. Considerations for the visually impaired led to customisable text options and diverse colour settings, including dark mode, black and white, and yellow and blue.<br><br>

                                User feedback prompted a reassessment of the community forum page naming conventions, validated through an online poll, necessitating strategic reworking to minimise confusion. Despite a positive online reception within the target audience, it's acknowledged that testing, limited to two app features in a controlled environment, may only partially represent the app's overall user experience in real-world scenarios. The inherent challenge with testing in the earlier stages lies in the app's orientation around user-generated content. Without UGC, the app would not function, making the app's final climate hard to predict with working comps alone. This underscores the ongoing nature of refining the app's design, strategy, and functionality, with future alterations expected. <br><br>

                                
                                One of the main feedback topics was concerns about the ABOA platform's unique value proposition compared to existing platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, or Discord. While there are many platforms for community spaces, ABOA specifically caters to the disabled community, offering a centralised hub for relevant information about disabilities in Australia and, eventually, the world. <br><br>

                                
                                The app's main feature was intended to be the locations function: for disabled Australians to get out in the community with fewer barriers. However, as it is easier to develop a UGC platform, the priority was to create the community feature and build the user base first to result in a continual feedback loop of communication between ABOA and its users to improve the app and its multiple features down the line. Regarding the Locations feature, it is enough with just user comments, but more research needs to be undertaken to understand what the backend of the locations feature could look like and how businesses and venues can get on board to provide accessibility information for the app so users have more to go off of than just UGC and reviews.<br><br>

                                
                                The next steps for the ABOA project involve a strategic progression towards refining and expanding its features. Recognising the importance of user-generated content, the focus will remain on growing the community feature to foster a vibrant and engaged user base. Continuous communication and feedback loops between ABOA and its users will be instrumental in shaping the app's evolution. I aim to enhance the user experience by addressing emerging challenges and incorporating valuable insights from ongoing testing and user interactions.<br><br>

                                
                                A pivotal aspect of the future of ABOA revolves around the Locations feature. Further research and development plan to explore the backend functionalities, ensuring seamless integration with businesses and venues is a possibility. The goal is to empower businesses and government entities to provide accessibility information, enriching the app's content beyond user-generated contributions and reviews. Establishing partnerships with companies and venues or the government will play a crucial role in enhancing the app's utility, offering users a comprehensive resource for navigating the physical world with greater accessibility.<br><br>

                                
                                As the ABOA project advances, after the app is tested and refined in Australia, considerations for scalability and global expansion will be explored. Building on the assumption of success achieved within the Australian context,  I envision extending the app's reach to a broader international audience, fostering a global support community for individuals with disabilities. This expansion aligns with the project's overarching mission of changing the world and creating a centralised and accessible platform that transcends geographical boundaries, connecting people worldwide and positively impacting the lives of those facing unique challenges.<br><br>

                                
                                In summary, the next steps for the ABOA project encompass ongoing refinement of existing features, exploration of new features, strategic growth of the user community, further research and development of the Locations feature, and eventually, exploration of opportunities for scalability and global reach.</p>
