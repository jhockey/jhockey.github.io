                        The Murdoch University NCP Scholarship Program provided a unique opportunity for eight high-achieving students, including myself, to collaborate on a client consultancy project in July 2023. Under the guidance of Erica Mason, the Academic chair for design thinking and service innovation at Murdoch University, also joined by Fioline Oetomo, a member of the 2022 NCP team and the 2023 post-grad team, we worked to amplify the impact of ‘Project Hiu.’ <br><br>

Project Hiu, (‘Hiu’ meaning shark in Indonesian) was initially a foundation aimed at eradicating the shark finning trade in Indonesia. However, through gathering insights to support the initial project, important discoveries were made that significantly shifted the scale and direction of the foundation’s perceived scope. We helped uncover systemic issues that supported the reasoning as to why communities in Indonesia have had to rely on the dangerous trade of shark fishing for survival across generations. Project Hiu’s shark problem quickly became a people problem. So, the mission changed to help the people of Indonesia, starting with the island of Marignkik, to foster alternative economic development and sustainable incomes for communities vulnerable to climate change, overfishing, and exploitation.<br><br>

Project Hiu represents a holistic approach to community development, focusing on sustainability and long-term well-being to eventually phase out shark fishing as the main occupation on the island. We aimed to use design thinking and co-creation to help project hiu find the most effective ways to assist Maringkik Island, engaging with the community, understanding their unique challenges, and harnessing their strengths. One of my team’s key contributions was the introduction of proposed outputs and prototypes designed to benefit Project Hiu’s image and bring attention to and expose the foundation to new audiences to bring in funding for future initiatives. This goal resulted in an awareness campaign tailored to the unique challenges faced by Maringkik Island. Each touchpoint was designed to enhance the reach of Project Hiu and, in turn, the lives of the island’s residents and their long-term sustainability. From the identified touchpoints, we were all tasked with developing one output for the prototype stage to propose the outcome and its benefits to implement them into the project. <br><br>

My role, identified on our two-week research trip and the touchpoint I was tasked with, was to elevate the brand identity of Project Hiu. My purpose was to prepare the foundation for its future audiences by innovating visually compelling ways to communicate the project’s values, mission, and diverse initiatives to the public to contribute to Project Hiu’s overarching design systems, service systems, conservation and community development goals in Indonesia.

                        Our journey commenced with an extensive exploration of Maringkik, Lombok, guided by Project Hiu’s overarching mission. Through repeated visits, interviews, and interactive experiences, we aimed to comprehend the local context intricately, identify community challenges, and pinpoint potential touchpoints for engaging a broader audience.

Through the vision of ethnographic research in Maringkik, we engaged in immersive experiences, embedding ourselves in the daily life of the Maringkik people. Discussions with Madison Stewart, the founder of Project Hiu, local fishermen, and community members provided nuanced insights into the socio-economic dynamics of the island. These interactions informed our understanding of the motivations behind shark fishing, the impact of Project Hiu’s initiatives, and the challenges in establishing sustainable alternatives. <br><br>

In-depth interviews with key stakeholders, including teachers, fishermen, and Project Hiu team members, offered diverse perspectives. We explored the fishermen’s motivations, the community’s response to Project Hiu, and the challenges encountered in transitioning away from shark fishing. Environmental contextualisation was crucial, addressing issues such as waste management, water sources, infrastructure deficiencies, and lack of education, all of which were huge problems on the island.<br><br>

Within the group, we based our approach on human-centred design; collaborative brainstorming sessions were integral to identifying issues and potential design interventions. Our focus extended beyond immediate concerns, aiming to address both pressing problems and their root causes.<br><br>

Persona development facilitated empathy with different stakeholders, allowing us to tailor touchpoints to resonate effectively. Systematic touchpoint mapping analysed potential interactions between Project Hiu and a broader audience, identifying key engagement moments to take advantage of and prioritise. In tandem, my desktop research played a pivotal role in identifying my touchpoint, the brand’s visual identity as something that needed to be prioritised with the new shift in direction and scope of the foundation. <br><br>

An external brand analysis in the conservation and tourism space yielded insights into effective communication strategies that helped identify other touchpoints to investigate. We examined successful cases to distil principles that could elevate Project Hiu’s brand presence. <br><br>

The insights from the research phase into the subsequent design process ensured that insights from Maringkik informed every facet of our touchpoint system. This comprehensive, research-driven approach laid a robust foundation for crafting individual touchpoints aligned with the overarching goal of fostering awareness and funding for the foundation. Also, it armed the post-grad team working from Australia with more information to work on their own goals within the project outside the awareness campaign.<br><br>

                        My focal point centred on developing a visual identity that would serve as the linchpin for Project Hiu's entire design system. The initial stages of research, problem identification, touchpoint mapping, and ideation unfolded during our immersive experience in Lombok. However, the substantial design work took shape upon our return home. Individually, we refined and amplified our touchpoints within the framework of a unified design vision.<br><br>

                        Upon returning, the ideation process became a collective effort intertwined with individual expertise. Focusing on the visual identity—the face of Project Hiu—desktop research augmented my understanding of current branding intricacies. This involved delving into colour psychology, typography choices, and visual elements resonating with Project Hiu's web of stakeholders. The challenge was not just creating a logo but establishing a visual system adaptable to the foundation's broad scope of work.<br><br>
                        
                        Collaboration was the cornerstone of our ideation process. Regular meetups became forums for sharing progress, offering insights, and ensuring cohesion across touchpoints. While my primary focus was on the visual identity, the input and feedback from my peers shaped the refinement process. Their touchpoints, whether focused on merchandise, social media, or tours, became integral parts of a holistic design system, using my developing visual identity as a basis for their work.<br><br>
                        
                        Experimentation extended beyond traditional design elements, delving into storytelling to immerse people in Maringkik's and Project Hiu's narratives. The aim was to solve the communication goals outlined in the brief, considering factors such as cultural sensitivity, community dynamics, and environmental context.<br><br>
                        
                        A vision emerged with the conceptualisation of pattern tiles—a visually compelling representation of the diverse initiatives Project Hiu undertakes. Inspired by the recurring mandala-type motifs in Maringkik's culture and around the island semi-adopted by Project Hiu, these tiles served a dual purpose beyond aesthetics. They became a visual narrative, communicating the essence of each endeavour, aligned with Maringkik's cultural significance. These pattern tiles innovatively addressed the challenge of communicating the multifaceted nature of Project Hiu's initiatives. Each tile, bespoke in its design, could create a cohesive and engaging visual identity adaptable to any scenario. It was a solution born out of experimentation, iteratively refined to align with the goals outlined in our brief.<br><br>
                        
                        This phase laid the groundwork for the outcomes and outputs of our work, solidifying the new branding and visual direction of Project Hiu through the development of a distinct visual language.

                        The final visual identity and overall brand of Project Hiu encapsulate a thoughtful fusion of purpose, symbolism, and cultural resonance. Every element was chosen to align with the foundation’s mission, ensuring a powerful and cohesive representation across diverse touchpoints.<br><br>

The shark fin logo, central to the visual identity, was crafted to symbolize Project Hiu’s ultimate goal—eradicating shark finning. The logo serves as a visual testament to the foundation’s commitment to supporting communities in moving away from this dangerous and unsustainable trade. It stands as a beacon of change, embodying the transformation of both the ecosystem and the lives of those dependent on shark fishing.

The intricate brand patterns draw inspiration from Maringkik’s cultural tapestry and the mandala motifs found in traditional garments and painted murals. These patterns serve as visual narratives, each telling a unique story of Project Hiu’s diverse initiatives. They foster a sense of unity and continuity, aligning with the cultural significance of mandalas in Maringkik.<br><br>


The innovative use of pattern tiles represents a pivotal design choice, visually communicating the multifaceted nature of Project Hiu’s initiatives. Drawing inspiration from the mandala motifs embraced by Maringkik’s culture, these tiles not only add aesthetic appeal but become a storytelling tool. Each tile bespoke in design represents a a specific aspect or area, contributing to a cohesive and engaging visual identity adaptable to any scenario.<br><br>

The current tiles created for the proposal include the primary brand pattern, waste management tile, and education tile.

                        After the NCP program and client consultancy ended, the team and I presented the outputs for a proposed awareness campaign, which garnered positive feedback from the project Hiu team, with my visual identity being implemented into the foundation’s operations. The Post-grad team shifted their focus to a collaborative transition into a new phase of the project, planning to initiate the next step of impact, leveraging our outputs to propel the project forward.<br><br>

                        Project Hiu’s mission extends well beyond the confines of awareness campaigns; our completed work serves as a pivotal element within the broader ecosystem of Project Hiu. The post-grad team’s trajectory is directed towards educational initiatives, a crucial facet of empowering the younger generation of Maringkik Island. Their objective is to cultivate self-sufficiency and community-driven solutions, emphasizing practical skills and knowledge that contribute to opportunities within the local community. This educational endeavour is not solely about sending individuals to school and university; it encompasses a comprehensive approach to uplift the entire island through knowledge dissemination.<br><br>
                        The next steps involve a thorough exploration of the distinctive challenges faced by Maringkik, guiding the post-grad team to craft targeted educational programs aligned with the community’s specific needs and aspirations surrounding water, waste and education.<br><br>
                        
                        Armed with fresh perspectives and fueled by the momentum of our work, the post-grad team aspires to create a space where education, along side a web of other inititives, makes a positive change on the island.
