                    <p>I’m Jack, a Perth-based designer with a bachelor’s in graphic design from Murdoch University. Over the past four years, I’ve taken on diverse design projects, showcasing my proficiency in design strategy, human-centred design, and design thinking. <br><br>

                        My portfolio reflects a broad spectrum of my work. I’ve engaged in a diverse range of projects, all with unique problems and goals. I’ve assumed leadership roles in large design teams and collaboration in smaller groups. I have also had valuable solo experiences working as a freelancer. <br><br>
                        
                        My design approach is anchored in a holistic framework influenced by design thinking principles. I adopt a 100-year mentality when looking to solve a problem, recognising that design problems are inherently dynamic and ever-evolving. The world changes, and so does design. Embracing this inevitability, I implement a framework that allows the solutions or outcomes of a project to be tested and measured to help it adapt alongside the people and environment it was made for.<br><br>

                        My framework is best described as a ‘design thinking framework’, a non-linear process that emphasises flexibility, iteration, and a continual focus on the target audience’s needs throughout the design process.<br><br>
                        
                        I approach a project by identifying a problem, defining its scope and objectives, gathering relevant data, ideating potential solutions, prototyping and testing those solutions, and finally, implementing the most effective outcome. The most important part of this framework is that it can be repeated indefinitely, allowing for a project’s strategy and outcomes to be measured, tested, refined, and improved iteratively, resulting in a better service, product, process or solution.<br><br>

                        Expanding on my design philosophy, a profound influence on my work has been my disability—I am legally blind. Contrary to its obvious disadvantage in the field, it has proven invaluable in my journey as a designer. I consider my visual impairment a strength, contributing to a distinctive perspective in my work.<br><br>
                        
                        This unique perspective has heightened my awareness of accessibility as a fundamental aspect of design for every individual, not solely those with disabilities. People encounter diverse individual barriers daily. Consider someone unfamiliar with design who may require assistance in understanding the terms throughout this portfolio—that’s an accessibility challenge addressable through thoughtful design. This underscores the importance of an empathetic approach toward people and their needs.<br><br>

                        By investigating the individuals my work will impact and deeply understanding the problems they face, I can craft outputs that genuinely cater to their needs. The goal is not just to comprehend their issues but to understand their pain points better than they might themselves. Whether it is the client or their audience, this deeper understanding allows me to ‘solve’ their problems more effectively.</p>

                        <h4>Design Thinking</h4>
                        <p>
                            Design thinking centres around people. 
                            It’s a problem-solving methodology that 
                            creates practical and long lasting solutions 
                            by deeply understanding a person’s needs.<br><br>
                            </p>
                            
                            <h4>Design Strategy</h4>
                            
                            <p>Design strategy is the intentional pursuit of
                                 designs that are impactful and purposeful. 
                                 It ensures that project outcomes not only look
                                  good but also actively contribute to strategic
                                   objectives and specific goals. In simpler 
                                   terms: “Designing with a purpose.”<br><br>
                                </p>
                            
                           <h4>Human-Centred Design</h4>
                            
                            <p>Human-centered design revolves around people. It’s a 
                                problem-solving approach that crafts practical and 
                                enduring solutions by placing a profound emphasis on 
                                understanding the needs of individuals. In simpler 
                                terms: “Designing with people in mind.”<br><br>
                            </p>
                        
                            <h4>Iteration</h4>

<p>Iteration in design refers to the repetition of the creative process, facilitating continuous refinement and improvement of design solutions.<br><br></p>

<h4>Design Framework</h4>
<p>
In the context of design, a framework is a structured plan or set of principles that guides the creative process, providing a systematic approach for organizing and streamlining design decisions.<br><br></p>

<h4>Output<br><br></h4>

<p>An “output” is the tangible result or end product of the creative process. It includes the visual, functional, or experiential deliverables that materialise from design endeavours.</p>
